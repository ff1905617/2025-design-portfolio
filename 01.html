                    <p>
                         REM is a film festival dedicated to surreal films. Many deal with experiences of alternate 
                         realities induced by dreams, dellusions and hallucinations while others exist in a surreal 
                         universe of their own. The experience is held at the Charles Hayden Planetarium in Boston, 
                         Massachusetts for maximum immersion. The dome-shaped screen and booming surround sound speakers 
                         are meant to transport the viewer into another world and leave them questioning whether or not 
                         they are still experiencing the one they were before they came in. 
                    </p>

        <h5>How did we get here?</h5>

        <div class="spacing-8"></div>

        <p>
            REM (Rapid Eye Movement) is a state of sleep in which the majority of our dreams happen. Brain activity during REM
            is similar to brain activity when we are awake, contributing to the dreams feeling real. Historically, surrealism has 
            lent itself to the idea of the "collective unconscious," a term coined by psychoanalyst Carl Jung. The collective unconscious 
            is a set of ideas and archetypes that all humans share in their subconscious that can be best accessed through dreams. 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>REM:</b> a state of sleep in which the majority of dreams happen. Brain activity resembles the awake state.</li>
            <li><b>Surrealism:</b> an art movement dedicated to exploring the unconscious mind.</li>
            <li><b>Collective Unconscious:</b> a term coined by Carl Jung describing a set of ideas and archetypes that all humans share in their subconscious.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="spacing-8"></div>

        <p>In order to flush out my ideas, I created a moodboard for a visual direction, 100 sketches of potential logos, and a list of movies
            that I thought would be appropriate for the festival.

        <h5>Logo Formula</h5>

        <div class="spacing-8"></div>

        <p>I eventually chose my favorite logo sketch. This sketch was inspired by a top view cross-section of a human head
            combined with a butterfly. I chose this final logo because it's expressive, abstract and lends itself to the idea
            of dreams and surrealism.</p>
